A fixed attention span means that we can limit our cache size using a rollingbuffer cache. The cache has a fixed size of W, and the keys and values for the timestep iare storedin position imodWof the cache. As a result, when the position iis larger than W, past valuesin the cache are overwritten, and the size of the cache stops increasing. We provide an illustrationin Figure 2 for W= 3. On a sequence length of 32k tokens, this reduces the cache memory usageby 8x, without impacting the model quality.1https://github.com/mistralai/mistral-src2https://github.com/skypilot-org/skypilot3https://huggingface.co/mistralai2']"," The Spatial Transformer was used in medical computer vision for image misregistration in cardiac segmentation by making changes to the FlashAttention and xFormers attention mechanisms, resulting in a 2x speed improvement over a vanilla attention baseline.

How can you terminate a Linux process using the `kill` command?,"To kill a Linux process, you can use the `kill` command followed by the process ID (PID) of the process you want to terminate. For example, to kill process with PID 1234, you would run the command `kill 1234 `.
